# Python codes to analyze the healing phase of the medium following the DAG-2 chemical explosion

The codes are for the following manuscript:
- Viens L. and B. G. Delbridge (Submitted to JGR), Shallow Soil Response to a Buried Chemical Explosion with Geophones and Distributed Acoustic Sensing


# Description:

- The **Codes** folder contains the codes to reproduce most Figures of the manuscript.
  - The LowLevel_callback_healing folder in the **Codes** contains a C routine written By Kurama Okubo (NIED). The original version can be found [here](https://github.com/kura-okubo/SeisMonitoring_Paper/tree/master/Post/ModelFit/code/LowLevel_callback_healing_distributed). The C library of the kernel of integration needs to be compiled with before running the Fig_3.py and Fig_5.py codes with:
  < align="center">gcc -shared -o healing_int.so healing_int.c<>
  - Once compiled, the path of the compiled file needs to be changed in the python codes.
   
- The **Data** folder contains the pre-processed data needed to reproduce the Figures.
- The **Figures** folder contains all the figures that are output by the codes.
